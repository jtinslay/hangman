# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1
- The GitHub repository is setup

## Milestone 2

- A list of 5 possible fruits is defined and one is selected at random by the code as the word for the user to guess. The user is then asked to enter a letter. The user input is validated to check if it is a single alphabetic letter. If the user input validation fails, the program exits with an error message. If the user input validation passes, the program exits with a message stating that the user input was valid.
